## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Environment Setup

```

## API Endpoints

### Video Management

- `GET /videos` - Get all videos
- `GET /videos/:id` - Get a specific video
- `POST /videos` - Create a new video
- `PATCH /videos/:id` - Update a video
- `DELETE /videos/:id` - Delete a video
- `POST /videos/generate-description` - Generate a description for a random video without a description

## AI Features

The application uses Google's Generative AI to analyze videos and generate descriptions. The process works as follows:

1. The system selects a video without a description from the database
2. It downloads the video temporarily to the server
3. The video is sent to Google's AI for analysis
4. The AI generates a description based on the video content
5. The description is saved to the database and the temporary file is deleted

## Scheduled Tasks

The application includes scheduled tasks that run automatically:

- **Generate Video Descriptions**: Runs 4 times per day (every 6 hours at 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00) to automatically generate descriptions for videos that don't have one.

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.
